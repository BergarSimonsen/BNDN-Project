Design changes
We described that we would create a dynamic web service as a backbone for clients to build up their own custom media rental service and we have stuck with most of our design choices, the only thing we have changed is how we handle data on the server and this does not influence the whole “dynamic” thing we were going for. Even though few changes were made to the design choices along the way it was not a complete success due to the previously explained problem with starting over after the SMU deadline much of the system is not yet fully constructed, since we did not have the time to fully develop the whole system we focused on first meeting the requirements and then use the remaining time on getting more of the system constructed.
